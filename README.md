## Preface

I'm not trying to evangelize AIML, far from it actually. I did however, spend a
day learning and exploring what it was all about, and hence, ended up with some
tools that make use of it.

Since AIML is so simple maybe someone can use this to convince someone to
pursue computer programming or something. The initial barrier to entry is really low
and the novelty factor is pretty decent. Anyway, here comes the rest of
the README!

## About

This little chat app makes use of the Sinatra Streaming API and the
programr gem to let you interface with an AIML chatter bot.

The streaming stuff is from https://gist.github.com/1476463 and should
be pretty straight forward.

AIML INFO: http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html

You can find a more complicated set of ALICE AIML files which have better examples of what AIML can do hosted at http://code.google.com/p/aiml-en-us-foundation-alice

Some of them have thrown errors in programr so a subset is available here: https://github.com/robertjwhitney/alice-programr
